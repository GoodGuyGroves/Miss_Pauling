# Getting Started

This community is based around a Discord server that you can join here: [4v4 PASS Time Europe](https://eu.discord.passtime.tf/)


## Rules

### 1: Be chill, keep it civil and respectful

We want to create a environment where people feel comfortable to play and want to play, if you create an environment where people refuse to play or would rather not add up, we'll ask you to tone it down or ban you if you repeat this offense. We expect you to act with a certain maturity level, this is not a kindergarten and others are not here to raise you.


### 2: We have a 0 tolerance policy on racism, transphobia, homophobia, harassment and toxicity

There is a difference between shit talking competition wise and blatantly being an asshole, say a slur once or similar and you are out.
Being an asshole outside of this discord will also be taken into account


### 3: Don't spam, no NSFW content

Spam messages and posting "not safe for work" content is not allowed.


### 4: English only, have a functioning microphone

We ask of you to be able to hold a basic conversation in English, PASS Time is a gamemode heavily reliant on communication. 
If you don't have functioning microphone or would rather keep your mic muted, we ask of you to not add up for similar reasons mentioned.


### 5: Remember to leave the queue

Remember to remove from the bot if you're unable to play. 
If you bait repeatedly while not removing from the bot we will ban you, as you are basically just wasting everyone's time by staying in the queue.


### 6: You must be engaged in pugs to play

Pugs are for fun, but you still need to actively communicate with your team and be engaged in the game. No excessive/intentional throwing or going AFK for extended periods. Ignoring the objective and or your teammates will ruin the game for the 7 other people on the server. (edited)Friday, August 29, 2025 at 11:15 PM


### 7: Have the weapons required to play the game

Please have the gunboats, crossbow, splendid screen, at the bare minimum to play. These weapons are fundamental to 4v4 pass time and you wont have fun or get the right impression without them. You will be locked out of fundamental game mechanics that 4v4 pass time is made around. Feel free to ask if anyone has spares they can send you.

Discord TOS must be followed in this server and any ETF2L Cheating and or any form of harassment Bans will be mirrored.
Any use of scripts or similar will be considered as cheating, for a list of bannable scripts please check the [recommended rules for PASS Fortress / 4v4 PASS Time document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AlcZo9s1-MckEXF3v15GrfYM6kqugv7G7OWns-In8Rk/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.odbv999qb42z) (which we are using).




## Binds

There are two PASS Time-specific binds you can utilise that only work during a game of PASS Time

- To call for pass: `bind "key" "voicemenu 0 8"`
- Instant resupply: `bind "key" "+sm_pt_resupply"`


## Maps

There is an "active rotation" map pool and a "reserve" map pool, both of which [you can find here](https://old.passtime.tf/maps). This is a 3rd party resource and may become outdated. If you find that is the case, you can let us know and we'll try to get it updated.

The above page also has a list of jump maps that are recommended for practicing rocket and sticky jumping which is heavily utilised in PASS Time.
