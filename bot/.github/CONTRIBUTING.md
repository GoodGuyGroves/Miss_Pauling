# Contributing to Miss Pauling
Thanks for taking the time to contribute! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Collaboration Goal

While working with others, please keep the following in mind:

- This project is very young and we welcome contributors of all skills.
- It is okay if the first few iterations of your code are not "perfect". We should strive to gradually improve our code.
- Please refrain from redoing/reimplmenting code that already works, in a new way.
- If you disagree with a decision that was made regarding a technology used or paradigm followed, please open an issue and we can discuss it.

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Please test your code if you are able to.
3. If you've crated/changed APIs, please document.
4. Develop your code making use of [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/)
5. Run your code through [Black](https://github.com/psf/black)
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU General Public License v3.0 License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GPL-3 license](https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v3-(gpl-3)) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/rsatf/Miss_Pauling/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/rsatf/Miss_Pauling/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/issues/2142) of a bug report made towards the Discord.py project.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
This project follows the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide. To help us stick to this guide, we make use of [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) and [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) to keep us on track.
